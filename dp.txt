Suitability of the 0/1 Knapsack Problem for dynamic programming...

1. Simple Subproblems:
For a 0/1 Knapsack problem the subproblems simply compose of either taking an
item (1) or not (0) that is decided on an item by item basis.

2. Subproblem Optimality:
The maximum value excluding the final item (N-1) can be computed and then the
final item (Nth item) can be included given that the weight is still below the
given weight. In this way the optimal subproblem is used to give the final
optimal solution.

3. Subproblem Overlap
We know that certain combinations of items will always give a weight that is
greater than the maximum weight and we can also find optimum subproblems that
will always give the best value for the given weight.
