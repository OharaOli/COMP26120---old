Task 3a:

The greedy algorithm may not always give an optimum value for the 0/1 Knapsack
problem because it works on the basis of the best value/weight ratio which in
turn relies on being able to select a fraction of an item to fill the remaining
space in the bag. In a 0/1 Knapsack problem this cannot be done and so it may be
the case that two items with a lower value/weight ratio may in fact give a
better overall value as they fill more of the bag. This would not be spotted by
the greedy algorithm, instead opting for a higher ratio value/weight that may
leave more space in the bag.
